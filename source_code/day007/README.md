# DAY 7

# Description
This whole day was about hangman.
I learned a new way to append iterables to a list. e.g., l += "a" which is not the same thing as l = l + "a"
Though, unless I'm golfing, I'll just stick to l.append("a")

# Environment
Using repl.it
Python version: 3.8.2

# Dependencies
repl.it account

# How to run script
```
c:\>python hangman.py
```

# Sample output
```

                   |___/

Pssst, the solution is flyby.
Guess a letter:
