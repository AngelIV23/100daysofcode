# DAY 1

# Description
This exercise was an introduction to python including printing, inputs, and variable usage. I took the quiz, but didn't get the final two or three questions involving args/kwargs in functions (no experience with these), so figured I'd start from the beginning and ensure I didn't miss anything.

# Environment

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies
No script dependencies

# How to run script
```
python band-name-generator.py

Your band name could be Zion Zoey
```
