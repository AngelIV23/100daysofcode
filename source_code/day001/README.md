# DAY 1

# Description
There was some introductory stuff to go through.  I signed a pledge.  I tweeted the hashtag for #100DaysOfCode to let everyone know.
I took the quiz and couldn't answer the last two questions.  Said I was placed in Intermediate Day 15, but I'll still do all Days.
Looks like we'll be creating a band name generator.
I learned about https://learnxinyminutes.com/ and http://pythontutor.com/
