# DAY 1

# Description
On this day the videos went over strings, string manipulation, functions (print
and input), variable assignment, and naming.  

The final project was a band name generator but instead I created a IAATJ name
handle generator. Mine is: Fullerton StorageWorks

Overall day 1 was very easy for me since I am not a beginner.  I did have to
google to find out the creator of the term 'bug'.  I thought the person was a
'she' but the video said a "he" invented the term bug.  Apparently Thomas Sloane
was the first and not Grace Hooper.
