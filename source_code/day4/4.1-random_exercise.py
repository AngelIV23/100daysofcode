# You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
# Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

# There are many ways of doing this. 
# But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. 
# Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

# 1 means Heads
# 0 means Tails
