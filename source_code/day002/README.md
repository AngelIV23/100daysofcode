# DAY 2

# Description
On this day the videos went over primitive data types, type error, type
checking, type conversion, math operators, PEMDAS, and f-strings.

What I found interesting was the image depicting the months to live.
The image is showing the months in tiny squares.  The image as a whole
is the months we usually have to live before we pass away.  Life is even
more shorter when looking at it from that image. lmao
