# DAY 2

# Description
On this day the videos went over primitive data types, type error, type
checking, type conversion, math operatores, PEMDAS, and f-strings.

What I found interesting was the image showing the months we have to
live.  Each month is pictured as a tiny square.  Life is even shorter 
when looking at it from an image timeline. lmao
