# DAY 2

# Description
Looks like we'll be making a food bill + tip + split app.

I like the use of the underscore as a separator in large numbers.  E.g.,  1_000_000 for 1 million

I learned about the round() function. I had been using print formatting to get certain decimal places.

I learned that in python, if you divide, the result is always a float (e.g., 3 / 3 = 1.0)

I learned about the floor division (//) to round down after/during dividing operations, which also removes the float in the above example ( 3 // 3 = 1)
