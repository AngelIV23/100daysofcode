# DAY 2

# Description
The final exercise of this day was creating a tip calculator. One thing this module reminded me which wasn't represented in the final project was accessing string elements by index (IE: every character in a string can be accessed by index). I also implemented data validation into the final code just for fun.

# Environment
OS: Windows 10

Python version: 3.9.1

# Dependencies
N/A

# How to run script
```
python tip-calculator.py
```

# Sample output
```
Welcome to the tip calculator.
What was the bill total? 124.75
How many people are splitting the bill? 5
What percentage tip would you like to give: 10, 12, or 15? 10
Each person should pay: $27.45
```
