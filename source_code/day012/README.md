# DAY 12

# Description
number guessing game.  I think this was mostly supposed to be about local and 
global scopes, but it wasn't needed.

It was a refresher for me, since I already knew about scope.

# Environment
Using repl.it
Python version: 3.8.2

# Dependencies
repl.it account

# How to run script
```
c:\>python sinister.py
```

# Sample output

sinister is thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

hard or easy: hard

you will have 5 attemps...let's go...

guess: 50
50 is too low
guess: 75
75 is too low
guess: 88
88 is too high
guess: 82
82 is too low
you failed it! it was 87!
